        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.The charset element sets our character encoding.

            The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content.
            
            The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage.
            
            </li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The `src` attribute defines the location, or source, of the image file.</li>
          <li>The `alt` attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.
          <li>The element that holds all the children—in this case, the body element—is known as the parent element.</li>
          <li>It is still common to see non-semantic elements such as div to create a division in the page, or span to create an inline division.</li>
          <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>the a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
          <li>!DOCTYPE This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. It is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>
          <li>we see the html opening tag, which represents the root, or start, of our HTML document.</li>
          <li>Inside the html tag is an attribute of lang="en", which tells the browser the language for the webpage (in this case, en for English).</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet. Let's explore these and then decide which approach we will use.</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They’re useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>An example of inline CSS is using the style attribute to change the color of a single h1 heading. This is shown in the following code snippet: Start of code snippet h1 style="color:red;">Prework Study Guide/h1</li>
          <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element. This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.

            The following code shows what an internal CSS style sheet looks like:
            
            Start of code snippet
            head
             style
               h1 {
                 color: red;
               }
             /style
            /head
            The preceding CSS states that all h1 elements on the webpage will be red.</li>
          <li> the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.

            When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head, as shown in the following code:
            
            Start of code snippet
            head
             link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" />
            /head</li>
          <li>a selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
          <li>The margin property acts much like a margin in a word processing document. A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.</li>
          <li>The padding property is often confused withmargin, but it is not the same thing. The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>
          <li>Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *. In this rule, we have declared that ALL of the elements on the page will have the style properties margin and padding set as 0:</li>
          <li>header,
            footer {
                width: 100%;
                height: 120px;
                background-color: blue;
                color: white;
            }
            Notice that in the preceding rule, we combined two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors. Rather than repeating a rule which would add more lines of code and repetition, two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together. This helps us write Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code.</li>
          <li>The h1 and h2 rule assignment is a positioning property, text-align. This is one way to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>
          <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup. The display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule. Use .card</li>
          <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
          <li>The first declaration addresses the width of the element at 80% of the available width.</li>
          <li>The margin property assigns 40px to the top and bottom, and the auto value to the left and right.</li>
          <li>The border property assigns a border with a width of 5px that is solid and gray.</li>
          <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color. In our example, the X offset is 5px and defines the width or extent of the shadow on the X axis (or to the right of the box); the Y offset is 10px and defines the extent on the Y axis (or just below the box). We haven’t defined the blur or spread radius here, but you’ll learn more about this in time. We’ve used an HTML hexadecimal code to define the color.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li></li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name. This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code.</li>
          <li>Finally, we use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable. Example var shape = "circle"</li>
          <li>All strings are surrounded by quotation marks. Note that each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon.</li>
          <li>To access the string "HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript", we can simply refer to the variable's name, topics. To see this in action, on the next line in your script.js file, type the following: console.log(topics); Here, we've added the console.log method to the file. We can use the console.log method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument. In this case, console.log will output the value of topics to the web console because we've added it as an argument inside the parentheses.</li>
          <li>Note that whereas the style.css file is linked within the head element, the script.js file is linked within the body element.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>To create an array, we declare a variable in the same way that we declared a variable with only one data item. That is, we use var and then give the variable a name. However, instead of assigning the variable to a single value, we assign the variable to a group of values. Example var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"]; </li>
          <li>Arrays are not limited to contain only a single type of data. A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on. Example var studentInfo = ["Lu", 54, true];</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement that we just learned, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
          <li>By using a for loop, we can tell the computer to go through each of the shapes in our array and log them to the console until there are no shapes left. In order to use the for loop, we need the shape's index and the array's length. The array length is important because the for loop needs to know how many times the code will run until there are no items left in the array. We can find the length of an array by using a built-in property of an array, appropriately named length.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements: The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is always 0), as shown in the following line of code: var x = 0;
            The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running. This will allow the loop to execute one time for each item in the array. We use the length built-in array property on our shapes array to express that condition, as shown in the following line of code: x ,less than, shapes.length;
            The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1, as shown in the following line of code: x++;</li>
          <li>A for loop starts with for. So far, our for loop looks like the following code: for(var x = 0; x ,less than, shapes.length; x++) {
             // code block
            }</li>
          <li>Finally, we put the code that we want to be executed for each loop inside curly brackets. In our case, we want each of the items in the shapes array to be logged in the console. In place of an actual index number, however, we can add the variable x from our for loop. Now, each time the code runs, x will increase by 1 and the next array item will log to the console. The following code shows how this is done:

            for(var x = 0; x ,less than, shapes.length; x++) {
             console.log(shapes[x]);
            }</li>
          <li>To create a function, we use the function keyword, similar to how we used the var keyword to declare a new variable. Then we give our function a unique name. We will use this unique name whenever we call the function.</li>
          <li>We didn't call the function! In order for the code inside a function to run, we need to call the function. To do so, type the name of the function in the console.</li>
          <li>Math.floor() and Math.random() are both properties of JavaScript's built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random number. </li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
