        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.The charset element sets our character encoding.

            The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content.
            
            The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage.
            
            </li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The `src` attribute defines the location, or source, of the image file.</li>
          <li>The `alt` attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.
          <li>The element that holds all the children—in this case, the body element—is known as the parent element.</li>
          <li>It is still common to see non-semantic elements such as div to create a division in the page, or span to create an inline division.</li>
          <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>the a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
          <li>!DOCTYPE This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. It is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>
          <li>we see the html opening tag, which represents the root, or start, of our HTML document.</li>
          <li>Inside the html tag is an attribute of lang="en", which tells the browser the language for the webpage (in this case, en for English).</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
