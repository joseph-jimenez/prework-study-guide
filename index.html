        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.The charset element sets our character encoding.

            The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content.
            
            The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage.
            
            </li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The `src` attribute defines the location, or source, of the image file.</li>
          <li>The `alt` attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.
          <li>The element that holds all the children—in this case, the body element—is known as the parent element.</li>
          <li>It is still common to see non-semantic elements such as div to create a division in the page, or span to create an inline division.</li>
          <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>the a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
          <li>!DOCTYPE This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. It is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>
          <li>we see the html opening tag, which represents the root, or start, of our HTML document.</li>
          <li>Inside the html tag is an attribute of lang="en", which tells the browser the language for the webpage (in this case, en for English).</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet. Let's explore these and then decide which approach we will use.</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They’re useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>An example of inline CSS is using the style attribute to change the color of a single h1 heading. This is shown in the following code snippet: Start of code snippet h1 style="color:red;">Prework Study Guide/h1</li>
          <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element. This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.

            The following code shows what an internal CSS style sheet looks like:
            
            Start of code snippet
            head
             style
               h1 {
                 color: red;
               }
             /style
            /head
            The preceding CSS states that all h1 elements on the webpage will be red.</li>
          <li> the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.

            When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head, as shown in the following code:
            
            Start of code snippet
            head
             link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" />
            /head</li>
          <li>a selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
          <li>The margin property acts much like a margin in a word processing document. A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.</li>
          <li>The padding property is often confused withmargin, but it is not the same thing. The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>
          <li>Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *. In this rule, we have declared that ALL of the elements on the page will have the style properties margin and padding set as 0:</li>
          <li>header,
            footer {
                width: 100%;
                height: 120px;
                background-color: blue;
                color: white;
            }
            Notice that in the preceding rule, we combined two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors. Rather than repeating a rule which would add more lines of code and repetition, two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together. This helps us write Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code.</li>
          <li>The h1 and h2 rule assignment is a positioning property, text-align. This is one way to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>
          <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup. The display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule. Use .card</li>
          <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
          <li>The first declaration addresses the width of the element at 80% of the available width.</li>
          <li>The margin property assigns 40px to the top and bottom, and the auto value to the left and right.</li>
          <li>The border property assigns a border with a width of 5px that is solid and gray.</li>
          <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color. In our example, the X offset is 5px and defines the width or extent of the shadow on the X axis (or to the right of the box); the Y offset is 10px and defines the extent on the Y axis (or just below the box). We haven’t defined the blur or spread radius here, but you’ll learn more about this in time. We’ve used an HTML hexadecimal code to define the color.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li></li>
